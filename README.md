# Interpreting-Automated-Chest-X-Ray-Using-Deep-Learning
A multi-label classification system based on training pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks

-Created a CNN model for detecting 5 thoracic diseases.

-Mapped the uncertain values in the CSV using Label Smoothing Regression.Trained a number of CNN models(like XceptionNet, EfficientNet, InceptionResNetV2, etc.)on all the images to identify multiple labels for each class.
